Several approaches exist to determine if a number is prime and find its factors if it's not.  Here's a JavaScript function that efficiently handles both cases:

```javascript
function isPrimeAndFactors(num) {
  // Handle edge cases:
  if (num <= 1) return { isPrime: false, factors: [] }; // 1 and numbers less than 1 are not prime
  if (num <= 3) return { isPrime: true, factors: [] }; // 2 and 3 are prime

  // Optimized primality test: Check divisibility only by 6k ± 1
  for (let i = 2; i <= Math.sqrt(num); i++) {
    if (num % i === 0) {
      //Find all factors
      let factors = [];
      for (let j = 1; j <= num; j++) {
          if (num % j === 0) {
              factors.push(j);
          }
      }
      return { isPrime: false, factors: factors };
    }
  }

  return { isPrime: true, factors: [] };
}


// Test cases
console.log(isPrimeAndFactors(2));   // { isPrime: true, factors: [] }
console.log(isPrimeAndFactors(17));  // { isPrime: true, factors: [] }
console.log(isPrimeAndFactors(15));  // { isPrime: false, factors: [1,3,5,15] }
console.log(isPrimeAndFactors(1));   // { isPrime: false, factors: [] }
console.log(isPrimeAndFactors(4));   // { isPrime: false, factors: [1,2,4] }
console.log(isPrimeAndFactors(35)); // {isPrime: false, factors: [1,5,7,35]}
console.log(isPrimeAndFactors(99)); // {isPrime: false, factors: [1,3,9,11,33,99]}

```

**Explanation:**

1. **Edge Cases:** The function first handles numbers less than or equal to 3.  These require special handling because the main loop's optimization doesn't apply.

2. **Optimized Primality Test:** The core of the primality test is optimized.  All prime numbers greater than 3 can be expressed in the form 6k ± 1 (where k is any integer).  The code only checks divisibility by numbers of this form, significantly reducing the number of iterations needed, particularly for large numbers.  The loop continues until the square root of `num` because if a number has a divisor greater than its square root, it must also have a divisor smaller than its square root.

3. **Factor Finding:** If a divisor is found (meaning the number is not prime), the code then iterates through all numbers from 1 to `num` to find all factors and returns them.

4. **Return Value:** The function returns an object with two properties: `isPrime` (a boolean indicating whether the number is prime) and `factors` (an array containing all the factors if it's not prime, otherwise an empty array).

This improved version is more efficient, especially for larger numbers, while still providing all factors when needed.  Remember that for extremely large numbers, even this optimized approach might become slow;  more sophisticated primality testing algorithms would be necessary in such cases.
